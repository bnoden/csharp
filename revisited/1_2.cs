/*2. Carbon-14 dating is a common technique for measuring the approximate age of matter that was 
once living. The formula for measuring time base on Carbon-14 decay is
t = (T / ln(2) * ln(1 + D / P)) where T is the half-life of Carbon-14
(5730 years), ln(2) is natural logarithm of 2, D is the amount of carbon-14 fund in a given dead sample, and 
P is the amount of Carbon-14 in a living specimen today. Write a C# program that asks the user input the value of 
D/P (such as 0.5) for a given sample and outputs the approximate age of the sample in years.
Use a named constant and a method in the problem. Output the result to two decimal places.

Sample Run:  
This program calculates the age of a dead sample based on the ratio of 
Carbon 14 in a dead sample.
Enter the ratio D/P: 
.05   
Given a D/P ratio of 0.05 for C14, the age of the sample is 403.33 years.
